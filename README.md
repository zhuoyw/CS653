# Fast Distributed Graph Random Walks on GPUs

Random walk has been recognized as a fundamental tool to analyze the graphs.
Many graph mining algorithms, such as Personalized PageRank, DeepWalk and Node2Vec have been widely used in various real-world applications.

However, existing distributed graph processing frameworks are not optimized for random walks. 

In this project, we propose a fast distributed graph random walk engine on GPUs.`
